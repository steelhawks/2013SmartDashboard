2013SmartDashboard
==================

Smart Dashboard extension

This is the Steel Hawks' extension for the Smart Dashboard.  It contains a simple Timer widget.
The project builds a jar file called 2601SmartDashboard.jar in the ~/dist folder in your NetBeans project folder.
1- This jar file must be copied to C:\Program Files\SmartDashboard\extensions.
2- Launch the SmartDashboard
3- Put in Editable mode
4- View->Add->Match Timer
5- Edit the properties.  Check off the Control box to display the reset and start/stop buttons.
  There are 2 alarms (Warning and Warning2) which will change foreground colors and play wav files.  (For some reason, not all wav files play.)
  The wav files should all be in the above extensions folder.  The times are all in seconds.
6- Toggle Editable mode to use the control buttons to start/stop and reset the timer.
